At the end of the task I understood that I've chosen the wrong data struct.
It will be better to use `linked-list` structure.

I've also didn't have enough time to finish this part:
```
(price=120.0, quantity=23.1) is a new ask position, you should add it to the asks of the orderbook
(price=80.0, quantity=12.2) is a new bid position, you should add it to the bids of the orderbook
```

but I commented with TODO how I'd implement it.
